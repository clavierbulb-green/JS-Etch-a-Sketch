A browser console-based implementation of an Etch-a-Sketch.

To draw on the grid, click and hold the mouse while moving the cursor over the
squares to color in. Clicking on a single square will also color it. To clear 
the grid, press the CLEAR GRID button. Pressing this button will also 
open a prompt allowing a grid with a new number of squares per side.

The program starts in BASIC drawing mode, where dragging the mouse changes the
color of the squares changes directly from black to white. By pressing the
TOGGLE MODE button, one can change between BASIC mode and FINE mode. In FINE
mode, the color of a square changes to a lighter shade of grey each time it is
drawn over, allowing for finer shading and expression.
