A browser console-based implementation of an Etch-a-Sketch.

To draw on the grid, click and hold the mouse while moving the cursor over the
squares to color in. Clicking on a single square will also color it. To clear 
the grid, press the button labeled CLEAR GRID. Pressing this button will also 
open a prompt allowing a grid with a new number of squares per side.

Inspired by and written as a solution to the practice project [Etch-a-Sketch](
